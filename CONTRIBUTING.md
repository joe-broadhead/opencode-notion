# Contributing

Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) first: it lists the rules for this repository and the APIs that must never appear in it.
[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) explains how the plugin works.

## Set up

You need Node.js 22.18 or later, npm, and [Bun](https://bun.sh). CI and the release use Node.js 24 and Bun 1.4.4, the Bun
inside stock OpenCode 2.2.3, 2.2.4, 2.2.5 and 2.2.6.

```sh
npm ci --ignore-scripts
```

### Run your checkout in OpenCode

```sh
npm run build
```

Then list the folder in `plugins`, as an absolute path or a path relative to the config file that contains it, and restart
OpenCode. One entry loads both the server part and the terminal UI part. Run `npm run build` again after you pull changes.

```json
{
  "plugins": ["/path/to/opencode-notion"]
}
```

## Check

One command runs every check, in order, and stops at the first failure:

```sh
npm run check
```

| Stage | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` over `src/` and `test/`, strict, with unused names as errors |
| `unit` | `bun test ./test/unit`: every module in `src/`, the docs' counts and error table, and the Jelly declaration |
| `build` | `node scripts/build.mjs`: deletes `dist/` and bundles `src/index.ts` and `src/tui.ts` with esbuild into the self-contained `dist/index.js` and `dist/tui.js`. Fails if a bundle imports anything the host does not provide |
| `icons` | `node scripts/check-icons.mjs`: the SVG is clean and exact, the 128 and 256 rasters exist, and `exports` and `files` agree |
| `host` | `bun test ./test/host`: the plugin inside an embedded OpenCode host, once on each tested release (`@opencode/sdk` 2.2.3, 2.2.4, 2.2.5 and 2.2.6) |
| `pack` | `bun test ./test/pack`: builds, packs and installs the package, imports both entry points, and loads it in stock OpenCode 2.2.3, 2.2.4, 2.2.5 and 2.2.6 |
| `forbidden` | `node scripts/check-forbidden.mjs`: scans `src/`, `test/`, `scripts/` and `dist/` for forbidden APIs and machine-local paths |
| `copies` | `node scripts/check-copies.mjs`: the tools RPC's shared part in `src/host/tools-rpc.ts` matches the copy every plugin carries, outside its `PLUGIN-SPECIFIC` block |
| `lint:actions` | `actionlint` over the workflows, when it is on PATH; CI runs it as its own job |
| `whitelist` | Checks `package.json` against the approved package shape, and that `dist/` holds exactly `index.js` and `tui.js` |

To run some stages only, name them; they run in the order given:

```sh
node scripts/check.mjs typecheck unit
```

Shortcuts: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, `npm test` (the `unit` stage), `npm run test:host`, `npm run test:pack`,
`npm run lint` (the `forbidden` stage) and `npm run drift` (the tool-table reconcile).

`TESTED_HOSTS` in `src/constants.ts` is the one list of tested OpenCode releases: 2.2.3, 2.2.4, 2.2.5 and 2.2.6. The host and pack
stages, status and CI all take their versions from it. Add a release there, and to the README's requirements, when every
check passes on it.

The host stage starts an embedded OpenCode host in a temporary home folder, with a local fake of Notion's MCP server and
sign-in server, once for each tested release. A request to any address other than the local machine fails the test. 2.2.3
is the locked `@opencode/sdk`; the stage installs the others from npm, outside this repository's lockfile, into a temporary
folder that it deletes afterwards (about 370 MB each, from npm's cache after the first run). To run the host stage on one
other OpenCode 2.2.x only, install that SDK in a separate folder and point `HOST_SDK_DIR` at it:

```sh
mkdir ../sdk-2.2.99 && cd ../sdk-2.2.99 && npm init -y && npm install @opencode/sdk@2.2.99 --ignore-scripts && cd -
HOST_SDK_DIR=../sdk-2.2.99 node scripts/check.mjs host
```

Every temporary folder of the host and pack stages is a git repository under the system's `/tmp`, never under `TMPDIR` or
your home folder. OpenCode looks for `.opencode` folders and project config upwards from a project, and stops at a
repository's root, so it never picks up your own agents or skills. Each stock server listens on its own free port.

The pack stage needs network access to the npm registry. It checks that the tarball contains exactly the `files` whitelist,
with fewer than 30 entries and at most 100 KB; that `dist/` holds only `index.js` and `tui.js`, with no relative import,
dynamic `import()` or `require()`; and that they import only modules OpenCode provides. It installs the tarball next to the
host packages that OpenCode 2.2.3 provides and imports both entry points under Bun. Then it installs the tarball alone and
loads it with `opencode serve` from stock OpenCode 2.2.3, 2.2.4, 2.2.5 and 2.2.6. Each server runs offline, in its own temporary
home, on its own port with a password. The stage checks that every path in `opencode debug paths` is inside that home, that
the plugin is active, that the `notion` server and the default rules are registered, that `/connect` lists the server as
"Notion", and that the status RPC answers. It then points a copy of the installed plugin at a local fake of Notion and calls
the tools RPC as a script would.

To use `opencode` binaries you already have, set `OPENCODE_BIN_2_2_3` through `OPENCODE_BIN_2_2_6`:

```sh
OPENCODE_BIN_2_2_3=/path/to/opencode-2.2.3 OPENCODE_BIN_2_2_4=/path/to/opencode-2.2.4 \
  OPENCODE_BIN_2_2_5=/path/to/opencode-2.2.5 OPENCODE_BIN_2_2_6=/path/to/opencode-2.2.6 \
  node scripts/check.mjs pack
```

Otherwise the stage installs `@opencode/cli` with the binary for your platform (macOS or Linux, arm64 or x64), a few
hundred megabytes per version, once per run, into a temporary folder that it deletes afterwards.

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `npm ci --ignore-scripts` and `npm run check` on Linux and macOS.

## Notion's tools

`src/notion-tools.ts` is the one record of the Notion tools the plugin knows: `READ_TOOLS`, `WRITE_TOOLS` and
`DESTRUCTIVE_TOOLS` give each tool its class, and `PARAMETERS` holds each tool's input parameters. The default rules for
every `access` value, the tools RPC's methods and classes, status's unknown and destructive tools, the fake server in the
host and pack tests, and the checks of `jelly.tools`, the docs and the skills all derive from it. Notion adds and changes tools without notice, and a plan or an
Enterprise tool list can leave tools out, so a known tool missing from one connection's list is not drift.

The names and classes come from Notion's own documentation of its MCP tools
([MCP overview](https://developers.notion.com/guides/mcp/overview) and the per-category references). That documentation
gives no input schemas and names only three annotations, so `PARAMETERS` is empty, and the skills name tools without their
inputs: in Code Mode each call's signature gives the model the parameter names.

### Reconciling with a live tool list

A signed-in connection's `tools/list` is the authority. **One form, one command.** A saved list is the server's own
`tools/list` response: `{ "tools": [ { "name", "description", "inputSchema"?, "annotations"? } ] }`, exactly as an MCP
client prints it. Save it with the MCP Inspector's CLI, which is the command this file names, without keeping the
credential:

```sh
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli https://mcp.notion.com/mcp \
  --method tools/list --header "Authorization: Bearer $NOTION_TOKEN" > tools-list.json
```

That is the one form this repository and the drift script accept, and
`test/unit/notion-live-tools.json` is the same shape, fed from Notion's documentation. **Replacing that file is the
reconcile step**: put the saved list in its place, then:

1. Run `npm run drift -- --strict`. It names every live tool with no rule, every class or annotation that disagrees with
   the rules, and every known tool whose input `PARAMETERS` has not recorded, and exits 1 while any of that remains.
2. Make `READ_TOOLS`, `WRITE_TOOLS` and `DESTRUCTIVE_TOOLS` name every tool the list has, once each.
3. A new name is a read only if `readOnlyHint` is true and it neither changes content nor sends anything anywhere. Anything
   that deletes, trashes, replaces a page's content, changes sharing or permissions, or sends data to Notion's team goes to
   `DESTRUCTIVE_TOOLS`. Every other write goes to `WRITE_TOOLS`.
4. If a read has `readOnlyHint: false`, or a write has `destructiveHint: true`, decide it again and record why in the file's
   comments.
5. Update `PARAMETERS` from the schemas, `jelly.tools` in `package.json`, and any skill text that names a changed tool. If
   Notion no longer lists `notion-ai-search`, remove it from `READ_TOOLS`; the rule and the script method go with it.
6. Run `npm run check`. The live-tools test names each difference the reconcile has left — a name with no class, a class
   the table does not have, an effect the value does not give it, or a deny that is not hidden; the Jelly test fails if
   `jelly.tools` differs from the lists; the skills test fails on a tool or parameter the record does not have; and the
   docs test on a doc that names a tool in no list.
7. Record the change in `CHANGELOG.md`. Moving a tool between the lists changes the default rules and the tools RPC's
   methods, which are part of the plugin's contract.

Notion's documentation also lists MCP resources (`notion://docs/memory`, `notion://docs/skills` and others) and a server
`instructions` field. Read the instructions when you reconcile: if they tell the model to save a memory or to offer
feedback unasked, add one line against it to the main skill.

## Commits

Use `type(scope): summary`, for example `fix(status): explain a revoked sign-in`. Keep commits small, and keep
`npm run check` green.

## Releases

### Versioning

The version follows semantic versioning on the plugin's contract: its options, the `/notion-status` command, the `/notion`
dialog, the skill names, the server name `notion` and its URL, the status RPC method, the tools RPC's methods and the default
rule behaviour. While the major version is 0, a breaking change raises the minor version, and anything else the patch
version.

Each release supports one tested OpenCode line, stated as `opencode.host` in `package.json` and enforced by the host check
(`SUPPORTED_HOST` in `src/constants.ts`). Both must change together, with the README's requirements. Each `CHANGELOG.md`
entry follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

### Releasing

Every plugin releases as `v0.0.0`, and it installs from that GitHub tag. The release is one commit on top of a `master`
head that CI passed, and the tag points at it.

1. Set `version` to `0.0.0` in `package.json`, date the `## [0.0.0]` entry in `CHANGELOG.md`, then run `npm run check`.
2. Push that commit to `master`, and wait for CI to pass on it.
3. In a clean checkout of `master` at that commit, run `node scripts/release-commit.mjs --ci-sha <its full sha>`. It builds
   `dist/`, removes the lifecycle scripts, and creates the signed commit and the signed annotated tag `v0.0.0`. It never
   pushes; `--dry-run` shows the change first.
4. Push the tag only: `git push origin v0.0.0`.
5. Approve the run in the `release` environment. The release workflow checks the tag and its commit, installs the tag on
   each stock OpenCode host (2.2.3 to 2.2.6), packs it, and creates the GitHub Release with the notes, the tarball and
   `SHA256SUMS`.

A tag that already exists stops step 3. Delete the old tag and its Release first, then start again.

A Git install is removed and updated by its installed spec: `opencode plugin remove github:joe-broadhead/opencode-notion#v0.0.0`. `opencode plugin update` and `opencode plugin check` take the same spec.
